# Filtools

We provide two modules: FilGen and FilAPT.
FilGen generates mock filaments which can be used to optimize filament finders and study different biases that may arise in calculation of filament profiles.
FilAPT analyses the filaments given its spine and phase space information of all the particles in the box. One can calculate curvature, smooth the spine and estimate 1D, 2D and 3D profiles of the filament.
